## Rest API for "My BabyApp" application
### Intrudaction
My BabyApp was developed for the infantry of Wolfson Hospital.<br/>
The purpose of the app is to create a platform that makes the life of both the parents as well as the infantry crew a lot easier.<br/>
Until today, parents with a child in the infantry would have to rely on themselves or on the availability of infantry nurses.<br/>
Due to the huge amount of false data on the internet, and most importantly the burden felt by the nurses, of dealing with uncountable questions from the parents, a need for an app arose and thatâ€™s when the infantry contacted us.<br/>
After listening to all their need, we started developing our app, and the result is My BabyApp. This app unites all the critical data required for the parents, all the relevant tutorials, and the option to sign up for an event and run tracking on the development of their baby.<br/>
By giving those options to the users, we are on the one hand making the life of the parents a lot easier during their stay, and on the other hand, allowing the nurses a lot more quiet and time to do their job properly.<br/>

The backend side was written in Node.js environment using the libraries Express, Mongoose and etc. <br/>
