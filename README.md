## Rest API for "My BabyApp" application
### Intrudaction
My BabyApp developed for the infantry of Wolfson Hospital.<br/>
The main purpose of the app is to create platform which make the life of both the parents as well as the infantry crew a lot easier.<br/>
Until today, parents with a child in the infantry would have to rely on themselves or on the availability of the infantry nurses.<br/>
Due to the huge amount of false data on the internet, and most importantly the burden felt by the nurses, of dealing with uncountable questions from the parents, a need for app arose and thatâ€™s when the infantry contacted us.<br/>
After listening to all their need, we started developing our app, ant the result is My BabyApp, an app that unites all the important data required for the parents, all the relevant tutorials, the option to sign up for an event and run a tracking on the development of their baby.<br/>
By giving those options to the users, we are on the one hand making the life of the parents a lot easier during their stay, and on the other hand allowing the nurses a lot more quiet and time to do their job properly.<br/>
